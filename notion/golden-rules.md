# Golden rules

The guiding principles of the Quark Ecosystem are as follows:

1. **Artist-Centric Approach**: \
   We strive to provide a positive experience for all artists working with our team. We offer fair pricing structures that acknowledge the value of their artistry and unique expressions. Their creative output forms the centerpiece of our collaboration.\

2. **Investor Engagement**: \
   We understand the importance of our token holders and aim to provide compelling opportunities for investment in the Quark ecosystem. We continually strive to pique their interest with timely updates and strategic developments.\

3. **Professional Conduct**: \
   The Quark team is committed to maintaining professionalism and transparency in all interactions with investors and artists. We believe clear communication is key to building a healthy, trusting relationship with all our stakeholders.\

4. **Freedom of Choice**: \
   In the Quark ecosystem, the choice always resides with the individual. There is no coercion; everyone is free to trade, invest, and manage their assets as they deem appropriate.\

5. **Dynamic Interaction**: \
   We aim to foster a vibrant and intuitive interaction among investors, artists, and the team. Our ecosystem embodies a democratic structure where everyone's contributions are valued and appreciated. We believe in creating an environment where everyone can contribute meaningfully and feel recognized for their efforts.

# Prerequisites

Our standards for artists contributing to the exclusive section are stringent; we envision this space as showcaseing only first-class NFTs. Our goal is to curate an assortment of NFTs that come with utility features, that create an enticing and comprehensive ecosystem for fine art collectors. We aspire for Quark to be the gateway that not only brings established collectors into our project but also introduces them, and perhaps a wider audience, to the vast potential of NFTs as a whole.

The distribution of royalties in the Quark ecosystem is managed on a case-by-case basis, tailored to each individual artist. This personalized approach ensures that both Quark and the artist reach an agreement that is mutually beneficial, enhancing the creative environment and encouraging continuous collaboration.

# Locker

Our project introduces a token and liquidity locker that can be utilized for any Alveychain tokens. This service is devised to bolster the security and versatility of all projects built on Alveychain, paving the way for increased trust and functional flexibility.

A standout feature of our liquidity locker is its capability for vesting tokens. This means that tokens can be set aside in a controlled contract, with predetermined release times to align with project milestones or a specific schedule. This vesting mechanism creates a predictable supply model, mitigating the risks of sudden token dumps that can affect a project's stability. The vesting process fosters trust between project developers and token holders, ensuring the strategic release of tokens that mirrors the growth and development of the project.

Moreover, our locker also offers a unique functionality allowing for the change of ownership of the locked tokens. This grants projects and token holders a high degree of flexibility. It accommodates various scenarios, such as shifts in project ownership or the strategic transfer of assets. Despite these changes, the security of the locked tokens is never compromised, ensuring a seamless transition.

In essence, Quark's token and liquidity locker provides an advanced solution for token management on the Alveychain blockchain. With its unique capabilities for vesting tokens and changing the ownership of locked tokens, Quark sets a new precedent for security, flexibility, and strategic asset management in the blockchain realm.\

The locker links can only be fully accessed by connecting to the locker at an Alveychain supported wallet.\


**Token Distribution:** \
\
16.5% of the total tokens are locked by the team:

* 10% development tokens, reserved for future project enhancement
* 2% core team tokens
* 4.5% investor tokens, to be relocked until the whole ecosystem is established. Control of these tokens remains with the development team until deemed appropriate for release, an arrangement agreed upon by the investors.\

* 28% burned. To demonstrate their commitment to our project, the community along with the blockchain Founder, have incinerated 28% of the tokens.
* The liquidity and marketcap ratio is **1 : 1.84** . _Currently LP 52.0k : MC 127.9k (31. December, 2023)_\


**Ecosystem Interaction:** \
Quark is committed to fostering a vibrant, inclusive, and democratic ecosystem where each participant's contributions are highly valued, and freedom of choice is paramount.\


**BuyBot and Revenue Generation:** \
The BuyBot tracks all token purchases on the Alveychain blockchain, facilitating seamless interactions across various project tokens. To generate revenue, the BuyBot runs advertisements, providing an opt-out option for individual groups. This ad revenue forms a crucial part of the project's income.

**NFT Collections and Marketplace:** \
Certain NFT collections are designed to fundraise for further project development and marketing. The marketplace also generates revenue through a standard 1% fee on minting operations, contributing to project sustainability and growth. [/nft-marketplace](../quark-ecosystem/nft-marketplace.md)\

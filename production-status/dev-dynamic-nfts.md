# dev - Dynamic NFTs

As we gear up to feature highly esteemed artwork, it is essential for us to ensure that our Dynamic NFTs reflect an equally esteemed level of sophistication. We envision our Dynamic NFTs as prized digital possessions which our users will be eager to display using digital NFT frames. This objective lies at the heart of our efforts in creating these NFTs.

Beyond the allure of aesthetic appeal, we are committed to incorporating additional unique utilities within these NFTs. Our aim is to curate an array of exclusive features that will captivate not only art collectors but also those with a broader appreciation for fine art. Through this integration, we aspire to elevate the value of our Dynamic NFTs, making them irresistible assets in the vibrant world of digital art.\


### Things we are looking into doing properly:

We do want to have collections where we sell the physical art piece as a part of the first NFT sale. To do this we are working on finding the best way to keep the NFT as an attractive asset for future trading while the first buyer is keeping the physical art work.

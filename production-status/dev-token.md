# dev - Token

Looking into ways to make the token more accessible for investors outside of the Alveychain blockchain.

* While we value cross-chain accessibility, our primary intention is not to bridge Quark token onto another chain. We are committed to preserving the exclusivity of Quark within the Alveychain ecosystem, in acknowledgment of our early investors' trust and belief in our project. \

* We are actively exploring possibilities to facilitate cross-chain interaction with Quark, considering various ways to implement this functionality. Despite our insistence on Quark's exclusivity on Alveychain, we believe that it does not restrict us from expanding our horizons in a forward-looking, secure approach for our entire ecosystem.\


### Currently looking into the following possibilities:



1. **Potential Introduction of miniQuark on Binance Smart Chain (BSC):** One possible expansion for our ecosystem could be the introduction of a companion token, called miniQuark, on the BSC. This move could enable us to engage with the vibrant BSC environment and provide fresh exposure for our project. Because of the tx fee at ETH we're a bit reluctant to implement at ETH chain, but we are considering that too.\

2. **Proposed Tax System on miniQuark Transactions:** To potentially support ongoing development and incentivize holders, we are considering the introduction of a tax system on miniQuark transactions. This could involve a redistribution of 4% of each transaction back to holders as BNB rewards, and directing 3% towards a fund for ongoing development and marketing efforts.\

3. **Potential for Equitable Rewards for All Holders:** With the spirit of fairness in mind, a similar reflection reward system could be introduced for holders of both miniQuark (on BSC) and Quark (on Alveychain). This could help ensure a balanced and attractive ecosystem for all holders.\

4. **Proposed Bonus for Loyal Quark Holders:** In recognition of your continued support, we are considering offering a special bonus to Quark holders who choose to lock their tokens. This could potentially take the form of a one-time miniQuark airdrop or a bonus percentage of reflection rewards.\

5. **Commitment to Transparency and Constant Communication:** As always, we are committed to regular updates, conducting AMAs, and providing educational content. Your insights and feedback are invaluable to us, and we want to hear your thoughts on these potential new developments.\

6. **Ensuring Security:** The safety of our community's assets remains our top priority. Any new development will involve thorough auditing by reputable firms and the implementation of secure practices.
